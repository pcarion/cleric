# Cleric

Cleric is a desktop application that helps you manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for [Claude desktop](https://claude.ai/download). It provides an easy-to-use interface for adding, removing, and configuring your MCP servers.

## How It Works

Cleric manages two configuration files:

1. A personal server list at `$HOME/.cleric.json`
   - Stores all your available MCP servers
   - Acts as a backup of your server configurations

2. The Claude Desktop configuration at `<OS specific path>/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Contains the active MCP servers currently used by Claude Desktop

## Key Features

- Seamlessly switch MCP servers in and out of Claude Desktop
- Automatically preserves server configurations when making changes
- Syncs with Claude Desktop: Any servers you manually add to Claude Desktop will be automatically added to your Cleric server list on next launch
- Real-time saving: Changes are saved automatically as you make them


## How to use

On the left side of the application, you can see the list of MCP servers that you have configured.

The servers with a checkmark are the ones that are currently configured in Claude desktop.

The right side of the application shows the information about the selected server:

The `Remove From Claude` button will remove the server from Claude desktop but the server will remain in your personal server list.

The `‚úÑ` button will remove the server from both your personal server list and the list of servers that are currently configured in Claude desktop.

The `üñäÔ∏è` button will allow you to edit the server information:

## Important Note

Before using Cleric for the first time, please back up your `claude_desktop_config.json` file if you have manually configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop.

# Acknowledgments

This project was my introduction to the Fyne toolkit. Special thanks to Alex Ballas's [go2tv](https://github.com/alexballas/go2tv) project, which served as an excellent reference. His well-structured codebase demonstrates Fyne's capabilities beautifully and provided valuable insights for building this application.
